# LaundryLine
This is a mobile application created using React Native that solves issues that UT students face with laundry in dormitories
through crowdsourcing. With the app, users can update and check the real-time statuses of washers and dryers on their residence floors.
The back-end of this application consists of user authentication and email verification with Firebase, storage of user login data and
laundry machine states in Firestore, as well as real-time customized group chatting and texting individualized for each residency floor
through Firebase's Realtime Database.
